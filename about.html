        About the Game
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Miyazaki Matching Game is a memory game with your favorite Ghibli characters. Every time you make a match you move Calcifer closer to his hearth before he becomes extinguished! But in order for me to make this game completely functional, I would need to learn Javascript, Photoshop, SVG animation, and improve my CSS skills.
